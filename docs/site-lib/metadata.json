Keep them brief and pointed.The epilogue begins when:\nThe Final Confrontation ends\nThe castle’s fate is sealed\nImmediate danger has passed\nCut hard. No slow fade.\nThe ground shudders one final time, then stills.\nBehind you, what remains of Kethrys does not explode. It does not collapse outward. Instead, the ruin folds inward on itself, stone and light bending as if drawn toward an unseen center. Towers shear away into fragments of pale geometry, their edges dissolving before they can strike the ground.\nThe sound is wrong. Not thunder. Not silence. A deep, steady pressure that fades as the castle shrinks, pulling its own shadow with it.\nFor a moment, you can see through the structure. Hallways overlap. Courtyards hang at impossible angles. Rooms you passed through flicker into view and are gone again, like memories slipping away.\nThen there is a final, sharp contraction.\nKethrys vanishes.\nWhat remains is empty ground, scorched stone, and a faint distortion in the air that slowly unwinds. The sky above snaps back into place. Wind returns. Sound returns. The world feels… heavier. Real.\nWhatever the castle was holding is gone now. Or sealed. Or moved beyond reach. You are left to wonder which. Reality has stabilized\nThe party is safe, but altered\nTime has resumed its normal flow\nThis is a moment of assessment, not threat.\nThe air nearby tightens.\nNot violently. Precisely.\nSpace folds along a single, clean line, as if reality itself has been carefully opened rather than torn. There is no flash, no thunder, no surge of magic. One moment the space is empty. The next, someone is standing there.\nHe has not arrived in haste. His boots rest firmly on the ground, as though it had been waiting for him. The faint distortion around him collapses inward and is gone, leaving the world abruptly ordinary again.\nThe man’s robes are travel-worn rather than ceremonial, layered with sigils that are faded from use, not neglect. His hair is threaded with grey that no glamour bothers to hide. His presence is not overwhelming, but it is absolute.\nHe does not look at the ruins where the castle stood. He does not survey the horizon. His eyes settle on you immediately, sharp and assessing, as though he has been watching from much farther away.\nFor a brief moment, his expression tightens. Not fear. Not anger. Relief, carefully restrained.\n“It is done,” he says at last, his voice calm and exact. “And you are still standing.”\nKeep this to three beats, no more.Beat 1 – Acknowledgment\n“You held what should not have been held. Most would have fled. You did not.”\nBeat 2 – Judgment\n“The cost was never going to be zero. What matters is that the breach did not spread.”\nBeat 3 – Consequence\n“What happens next is not mine to decide alone. But neither is it forgotten.”\nDo not explain further unless asked.Choose the Patron’s tone based on the party’s performance:\nCalm approval\nMinimal commentary\nSubtle respect Acknowledgment of sacrifice\nNo consolation\nClear gravity Unease\nWarning rather than praise\nHints of future consequence\nThe Patron never lies. They also never comfort.Have the Patron reference 2 concrete outcomes:\nThe fate of Kethrys\nThe wider planar balance\nWho will now notice the party\nEach is one sentence. No lore dump.Give the players space.Ask one open question:\n“Do you answer?”\n“Do you ask anything?”\n“Do you say nothing?”\nLet each character respond briefly or choose silence.Silence is a valid choice.After the Patron departs, go around the table.For each character:\nOne sentence on how this encounter changes them\nOr one decision they make moving forward\nDo not allow cross-talk here.Describe the Patron leaving:\nNo flash\nNo portal\nNo spectacle They are simply no longer there.\nThe world feels smaller without them.End on a grounded image, not the Patron.Examples:\nDawn over broken stone\nThe road away from Kethrys\nA quiet moment tending wounds\nThen stop.The session ends when:\nEvery player has had one closing moment\nThe Patron has departed\nThe final image is delivered\nDice down.

Unstable Terrain Crumbling edges\nPlanar fissures\nShifting cover Environmental Hazards Falling debris\nSurging energy\nCollapsing ground Failure Modes:\nPoor positioning is punished quickly\nStaying still is dangerous The Planar Warden Focused on containment failure\nSingle-minded\nNot interested in negotiation Optional:\nNPCs (if previously escorted)\nEnvironmental forces acting like lair actions The Warden does not need to be killed to “win”\nSurvival, escape, or banishment are valid victories\nThe fight should escalate quickly\nIf combat drags, increase environmental pressure.\nFight or flee?\nDistract or sacrifice?\nUse the environment or stand toe-to-toe?\nIf players hesitate:\nThe Warden acts decisively\nThe terrain worsens\nEscalation Track:\nWarden enters fully\nEnvironment destabilizes each round\nTotal collapse imminent\nAdvance escalation every round or major beat.Success:\nThe party survives\nThe Warden is defeated, banished, or delayed\nThe castle is left behind\nFailure:\nCharacter death or capture\nPermanent scars or loss\nPyrrhic survival\nAvoidance:\nNot possible. This is the end.

Summary - The Last Anchor of Aethyra","icon":"","description":"A time-pressured planar dungeon one-shot where the dungeon itself is the primary antagonist.The players are sent into a collapsing planar ruin that cannot be saved. Their goal is not victory, conquest, or exploration, but containment. Every meaningful decision trades speed for safety, or safety for cost.This adventure is about acting under inevitability.At the table, players will:\nNavigate a dungeon that phases in and out of reality\nMake forced choices under visible time pressure\nDecide who to help and who to leave behind\nManage risk rather than optimize combat\nEscape while being actively pursued\nThere is no room-by-room clearing. There is no safe path.\nThe dungeon is leaving reality and does not wait for the party\nTime pressure is enforced, not implied\nInterior spaces change instead of expanding\nThe primary threat pursues the party out of the dungeon\nSuccess is defined by impact, not survival alone\nPlayers are not uncovering secrets. They are racing inevitability.\nIntroduction: Patron briefing and forced commitment\nAct I: Entry into a phasing planar ruin\nAct II: Shifting interiors, unstable navigation, and moral friction\nAct III: Keystone extraction, pursuit, collapse, and final confrontation\nEpilogue: Judgment, consequence, and aftermath\nThe adventure contains six primary locations and no filler scenes.\nUrgency without panic\nUnstable reality\nImperfect victories\nConsequences that persist\nThis is not a heroic power fantasy. It is a controlled disaster response.This adventure assumes the DM is willing to:\nEnforce time pressure visibly\nSay “you do not have time” and mean it\nLet players fail forward\nEnd scenes decisively\nDeliver consequences without softening them\nIf you hesitate to push pacing, this adventure will stall.This is not a good fit if your table expects:\nA traditional room-by-room dungeon crawl\nGuaranteed clean victories\nLong rests and reset points\nExtensive lore discovery\nCombat in every scene\nRunning it that way will break the experience.Possible endings include:\nThe region is spared widespread devastation at severe local cost\nThe party escapes alive but changed\nSomething follows them out\nThe patron is proven correct, but not comforted\nAll outcomes are valid if the pressure led there honestly.Run The Last Anchor of Aethyra if you want:\nA tight, high-tension one-shot\nMeaningful choices without obvious right answers\nA dungeon that feels alive and hostile\nA session that ends decisively, not politely\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#one-shot","#planar","#time-pressure","#overview"],"headers":[{"heading":"The Last Anchor of
