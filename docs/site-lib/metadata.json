An ancient planar ruin known as Kethrys is in the final stages of phasing out of the Material realm. The party has a narrow window to enter, retrieve or neutralize a final planar keystone, and escape before the structure completes its transit.This is not an exploration dungeon. It is a controlled extraction under escalating pressure.\nThe dungeon is actively leaving reality\nTime pressure is visible and enforced\nInterior geometry shifts instead of expanding\nThe primary threat does not wait at the end but pursues the party out of the dungeon\nPlayers are not uncovering secrets. They are racing inevitability.The party is summoned by their long-time patron, Archwizard Thalos Aethyrian, a powerful planar scholar who has tracked Kethrys for years. He is clear and unsentimental.Kethrys cannot be stopped. Five of its six anchors are already gone. One remains inside.If Kethrys departs with that anchor intact, the resulting planar rupture will devastate the region for miles. If the anchor is removed or destroyed before the transit completes, the damage will still occur but will be localized to the castle’s exit point.The party is not being sent to prevent disaster. They are being sent to contain it.Every meaningful choice trades time for safety or speed for risk.\nAid others and fall behind\nPress forward and leave consequences unresolved\nFight and lose precious moments\nEscape cleanly or escape alive\nThere is no path that avoids loss entirely.\nAct I: Forced entry into a phasing planar ruin\nAct II: Shifting interiors, unstable navigation, and moral friction with stranded scavengers\nAct III: Keystone extraction, activation of a planar warden, pursuit, and a final confrontation beyond the dungeon\nThe dungeon contains six meaningful spaces.

There is no time.” How long the castle will remain accessible What guards the final anchor Whether anything inside understands what is happening Not because he is cruel. Because he does not know.\nNever raise his voice Never speculate aloud Never promise success Treat the party as capable adults, not heroes He is not sending them to win. He is sending them to limit the damage.DM Framing and OpeningThalos Aethyrian has been your patron for years. When he summons you personally, it is never for routine work.This time, he looks tired in a way you have never seen before.He does not sit you down. He does not explain the situation. He presses a sealed letter into your hands and says:\n“Read this on the way. There is no time to explain.”\nWith a single spell, the world folds.Moments later, you are standing in an open field beneath a fractured sky. The air hums. Reality feels thin. In the distance, a ruined castle flickers in and out of existence, each phase carrying it farther from the world you know.The letter in your hand details what Thalos knows with certainty. The castle is leaving. One final anchor remains inside. If it is not removed, the damage will be widespread and irreversible.You cannot stop what is happening.You can only decide how bad it will be.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Archwizard Thalos Aethyrian</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Archwizard_Thalos_Aethyrian**_0"},{"heading":"WHO THALOS IS (DM CONTEXT)","level":3,"id":"WHO_THALOS_IS_(DM_CONTEXT)_0"},{"heading":"WHAT THALOS KNOWS WITH CERTAINTY","level":3,"id":"WHAT_THALOS_KNOWS_WITH_CERTAINTY_0"},{"heading":"WHAT THALOS SAYS ALOUD","level":3,"id":"WHAT_THALOS_SAYS_ALOUD_0"},{"heading":"<em>The spell completes before questions can be asked.</em>","level":3,"id":"_The_spell_completes_before_questions_can_be_asked.__0"},{"heading":"WHAT THALOS WITHHOLDS","level":3,"id":"WHAT_THALOS_WITHHOLDS_0"},{"heading":"HOW TO ROLEPLAY THALOS","level":3,"id":"HOW_TO_ROLEPLAY_THALOS_0"},{"heading":"DM INTRODUCTION CARD (GREEN-DM FRIENDLY)","level":2,"id":"DM_INTRODUCTION_CARD_(GREEN-DM_FRIENDLY)_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The Last Anchor of Aethyra</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_Last_Anchor_of_Aethyra**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"one-shots/the-last-anchor-of-aethyra/npcs/patron-archwizard-thalos-aethyrian.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["assets/the-last-anchor-of-aethyra-mission-letter.html"],"createdTime":1768771876533,"modifiedTime":1768774075713,"sourceSize":4824,"sourcePath":"One Shots/The Last Anchor of Aethyra/NPCs/PATRON Archwizard Thalos Aethyrian.md","exportPath":"one-shots/the-last-anchor-of-aethyra/npcs/patron-archwizard-thalos-aethyrian.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":20,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"one-shots/the-last-anchor-of-aethyra/npcs/planar-warden.html":{"title":"Planar Warden","icon":"","description":"Role: Pursuer, final pressure, containment enforcer\nType: Medium Construct (Planar)\nAlignment: Unaligned\nMindset: Corrective, relentless, silentThe thing that emerges from Kethrys is not born of flesh or intent.Stone and sigil interlock around a hollow core of warped light.
